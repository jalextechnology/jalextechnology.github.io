            <p>I specialize in technical services such as home networking, AV maintenance and installations, network infrastructure,</p>
            <p>system administration, and even some coding. My approach is customer-centric, aiming to make IT accessible and easy</p>
            <p>to understand for users of all levels. I believe in educating clients while solving their IT challenges. My expertise </p>
            <p>spans Azure, Intune, SCCM, Active Directory, and various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, and mobile</p>
            <p>platforms. Whether working independently or collaborating with others, I'm committed to delivering exceptional service.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My lifelong passion for IT ensures I stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I immerse myself in every project,</p>
            <p>ensuring a deep understanding even in unfamiliar territories. My work process begins with a thorough understanding of your needs.</p>
            <p>I research and document every step, making sure you're informed throughout the project. Customer satisfaction is my priority, and </p>
            <p> I'm always willing to go the extra mile to exceed expectations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm available after hours and on weekends to accommodate your schedule, as I also have a full-time job. When I'm not immersed in IT,</p>
