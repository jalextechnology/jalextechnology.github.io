        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Alex le Roux, an IT consultant with a lifelong passion for technology. With a background in a wide range of IT disciplines and certifications like Crestron Technician and Azure Administrator, I bring a wealth of knowledge to every project.</p>

        <p>My experience includes working as a Desktop Engineer at Toi Ohomai and assisting in Azure administration for Te Pukenga. I specialize in technical services such as home networking, AV maintenance and installations, network infrastructure, system administration, and even some coding.</p>

        <p>My approach is customer-centric, aiming to make IT accessible and easy to understand for users of all levels. I believe in educating clients while solving their IT challenges. My expertise spans Azure, Intune, SCCM, Active Directory, and various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, and mobile platforms.</p>

        <p>Whether working independently or collaborating with others, I'm committed to delivering exceptional service. My lifelong passion for IT ensures I stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I immerse myself in every project, ensuring a deep understanding even in unfamiliar territories.</p>

        <p>My work process begins with a thorough understanding of your needs. I research and document every step, making sure you're informed throughout the project. Customer satisfaction is my priority, and I'm always willing to go the extra mile to exceed expectations.</p>

        <p>I'm available after hours and on weekends to accommodate your schedule, as I also have a full-time job. When I'm not immersed in IT, I'm a passionate nerd with interests in film, music, media, tech, and marketing.</p>
